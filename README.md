# Tic-Tac-Toe #

#### By Katrina Hirsch & Mark Lawson (August 25th, 2016)

## Description ##

Tic Tac Toe is a game in which players alternate marking squares on a board. The first player to mark three squares in a series wins. This version of Tic-Tac-Toe was built to demonstrate how object-oriented JavaScript can be used to simulate traditional 2-D games.

## Specifications ##

* A marker will appear on the board when the current player clicks on a square.

* When a player clicks a square, switch to opposite player's turn.

* Players cannot click a square that has already been marked.

* Game ends when a player marks three squares in series.

* Game ends when all squares are filled but neither player has successfully filled three within a series.
